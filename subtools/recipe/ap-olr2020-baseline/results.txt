Update by Zheng Li in July 2020

Update information (July 2020):
1. The EER result of the i-vector system in Cross-channel LID task on AP20-OLR-ref-dev was corrected.
2. The script for Cavg of open-set dialect identification task was changed in which a bug was fixed, resulting in the new Cavg results on  open-set dialect identification task.
3. For open-set dialect identification task, a new script named computeCavg_unknown.py was provided to compute Cavg and it will be used in the final test procedure.

AP20-OLR challenge sets three tasks that will be evaluated and ranked separately.

Task 1: Cross-channel LID is a close-set identification task, which means the language of each utterance is among the known traditional 6 target languages, but
utterances were recorded with different channels.

Task 2: Dialect identification is a open-set identification task, in which three nontarget languages are added to the test set with the three target dialects.

Task 3: Noisy LID, where noisy test data with the 5 target languages will be provided
